the water was clear like a clear thing
When someone calls, my phone goes ring ring
I pick it up like trash on the ground
and to my suprise I hear a great sound
to my surprise silence pierces the air
This calls for a break so I sit on a lawnchair
and yet I live in a lawnless land
I high five my opponents face with my massive hand
The End
